Goals:
- be a portfolio(and a piece itself) to showcase my personal projects
    - more than just linking, be able to have some kind of preview(images, interactive)
- look good, let me learn how to make things look good
- be scalable, allow me to add in interesting projects and contents
- provide some benefit over other sites, convey a personal custom sense of style
