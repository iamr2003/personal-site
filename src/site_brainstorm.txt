Goals:
- be a portfolio(and a piece itself) to showcase my personal projects
    - more than just linking, be able to have some kind of preview(images, interactive)
- look good, let me learn how to make things look good
- be scalable, allow me to add in interesting projects and contents
- provide some benefit over other sites, convey a personal custom sense of style
    - needs to be unique, don't just copy formats(maybe will shy away from manite, we will see)
- expansion if I wanted to create a blog or something
    - or even just condensing some of the QA stuff I do
- eventually to be just a sandbox for what I do, will likely evolve rapidly

daniel's is a pretty simple scrolling type thing, made in eecs 493 I think https://danlliu.github.io/

Attributes
- expandable
- smooth ways to swap theming/components, reusable and modular
- a simple way to add more entries, default datatypes and setups(editor mode of future)
- code is generally useful
- would like opportunity for framework merging(web components?), but that may be difficult

General side project things
- responsive accessible, easy to pickup for future
    - basically always web
- involves some learning opportunity

Pages/Elements:
- fancy splash screen at some point

- About me
    - relevant links, etc. name, enthusiasm, clubs

columns of skills in different jobs(Robotics/CS)

- contact method




- list of projs
    - front and center
    - image short explanation
    - web preview would be really cool
        - this could be expandable
    - sorted by different criteria, able to be more exhaustive

Nice Navbar(creative ways?), across top default

Task list:
- Across the Top navbar(no URL change for now)
    - implemented with tabs, will want to eventually be button based, maybe vertical nav
- project list of cards
    - pretty good, more figure out a way to shorten, or split pages off
    - maybe some video support

- A nice header
    - probably should have my name in it

- style edu and job cards, probably make a lot smaller

-figure out scrolling handle, to swap states if scroll to bottom

https://thewebdev.info/2021/09/25/how-to-detect-when-a-user-scrolls-to-bottom-of-div-with-react/

mmm scrollArea might be useful, better than my current fixed hack



- clean up theming(maybe later, defaults look good too)

To compare:

    - a little over the top imo, and over attributes class projs
https://danlliu.github.io/
    - ok I can do more than this one design-wise, info is inspirational
    - icons can be super helpful
https://www.zolyo.me/
    - made with pure react
    - breaks on mobile(which is interesting, since he does app dev)
https://www.pbb.wtf/
    - probably part of my endgame


Next Steps:
- routing, ability to tag more media with projects
- better sorting, ability to index projects by language, clipping
- add dates as well to project sorting

Things to fix with first release:
- top bit of overflow
- some icon changes to first pages
- actually write words about my bio...
-
