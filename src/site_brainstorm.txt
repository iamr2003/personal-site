Goals:
- be a portfolio(and a piece itself) to showcase my personal projects
    - more than just linking, be able to have some kind of preview(images, interactive)
- look good, let me learn how to make things look good
- be scalable, allow me to add in interesting projects and contents
- provide some benefit over other sites, convey a personal custom sense of style
    - needs to be unique, don't just copy formats(maybe will shy away from manite, we will see)
- expansion if I wanted to create a blog or something
    - or even just condensing some of the QA stuff I do
- eventually to be just a sandbox for what I do, will likely evolve rapidly

daniel's is a pretty simple scrolling type thing, made in eecs 493 I think https://danlliu.github.io/

Attributes
- expandable
- smooth ways to swap theming/components, reusable and modular
- a simple way to add more entries, default datatypes and setups(editor mode of future)
- code is generally useful
- would like opportunity for framework merging(web components?), but that may be difficult

General side project things
- responsive accessible, easy to pickup for future
    - basically always web
- involves some learning opportunity

Pages/Elements:
- fancy splash screen at some point

- About me
    - relevant links, etc. name, enthusiasm, clubs

columns of skills in different jobs(Robotics/CS)

- contact method




- list of projs
    - front and center
    - image short explanation
    - web preview would be really cool
        - this could be expandable
    - sorted by different criteria, able to be more exhaustive

Nice Navbar(creative ways?), across top default

Task list:
- Across the Top navbar(no URL change for now)
    - implemented with tabs, will want to eventually be button based, maybe vertical nav
- project list of cards
    - I wanted some kind of sorting, idk exactly how yet
    - Title(linked), start date, end date(maybe cleanup), body, image
    - role
    - clipping
    - milking school projects more too
    - also list older projects too
    - figure out a recency biaser/something

- A nice header
- education list
    - classes, etc.


- clean up theming(maybe later, defaults look good too)

To compare:

    - a little over the top imo, and over attributes class projs

    - ok I can do more than this one design-wise, info is inspirational
    - icons can be super helpful

    - made with pure react
    - breaks on mobile(which is interesting, since he does app dev)
